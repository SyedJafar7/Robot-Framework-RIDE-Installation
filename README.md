There are some pre-requisite we need to install before going for the robot framework installation. These are mention below:
#	Installation of Python 2.7 Version of 32 bit ( As Python version higher than 2.7 will not support robot framework)
# Set the path in environment variable for Python
# wxPython 32 bit Installation (make sure you should install the wxPython version same as the python version i.e. Python 2.7)
#Installation of robotframework-ride-1.3 version (robotframework-ride-1.5 version will not support Python 2.7)
